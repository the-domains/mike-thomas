According to almost 12,000 diary entries by over 200 people on project teams, the most common event that triggered people's best days on the job was making progress in their work. The event that triggered their worst days was experiencing a setback. "This is the progress principle made visible," write Teresa Amabile and Steven J. Kramer on HBR.org. "If a person is motivated and happy at the end of the workday, it's a good bet that he or she made some progress. If the person drags out of the office disengaged and joyless, a setback is most likely to blame." In addition, triggers that Amabile and Kramer call inhibitors and toxins, explained in the chart below, are rare on great days of work.
